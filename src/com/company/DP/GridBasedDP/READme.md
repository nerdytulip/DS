- **Grid-Based DP**
    - **Description:**  
      Problems where the state transition depends on neighboring cells in a grid.
    - **Recurrence:**
        - `dp[i][j] = cost[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
        - Used for path minimization, maximal areas, and matrix-based DP.
    - **Problems:**
        - Minimum Path Sum
        - Maximal Square
        - Maximal Rectangle
        - Largest Square in a Matrix
