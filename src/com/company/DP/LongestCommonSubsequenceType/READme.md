- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Type**
    - **Description:**  
      Problems that involve finding the longest common subsequence or variations of it.
    - **Recurrence:**
        - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
        - `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]` if characters match.
    - **Problems:**
        - Longest Common Subsequence
        - Edit Distance
        - Wildcard Matching
        - Regular Expression Matching
        - Longest Palindromic Subsequence
