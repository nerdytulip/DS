     * Problem Statement:
     * You're given an array housePrices where each element housePrices[i] represents the price of a house on the i-th day.
     * You want to make the most profit by choosing a single day to buy a house and a later day to sell it. Your goal is to determine the maximum profit you can earn from this single transaction.
     * Write a function that returns the maximum possible profit. If thereâ€™s no opportunity to make a profit, return 0.
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: housePrices = [700, 100, 500, 300, 600, 400]
     * Output: 500
     * Explanation:
     * Buy on day 2 at price = 100, sell on day 5 at price = 600. Profit = 600 - 100 = 500.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: housePrices = [700, 400, 600, 300, 100]
     * Output: 0
     *
     * Explanation:
     * House prices are decreasing every day, so no profit is possible.
